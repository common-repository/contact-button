== Description ==
Contact Button helps you get more leads by providing website visitors with 1-click access to 15 highly-customizable apps designed to solve the most common small business use cases. Once you’ve successfully installed this plugin, your Contact Button will immediately show up in the corner of your website.

The easiest way to think of this plugin is that it’s comparable to adding a smartphone to the corner of your site.
